        submitted and retained. c. The technical goods and services provided by brewsta.com.au may be subject to errors, bugs,

        Methods of Payment a. Payment for the goods must be made either by cash to the Food Provider on the collection of goods,
        or Credit card to brewsta.com.au on completion of the order (whichever is applicable). b. If payment is made by Credit
        card, the order placed will not be placed or supplied to You until payment has been processed and approved. c. The
        gateway verifies credit cards by running either a $0 or $1 authorization and then automatically voiding it. For most
        processors, Visa and Mastercard are initially tried with $0 authorizations. Because some card types don’t consistently
        support $0 authorizations, they are only tried with $1 requests. In any instance where a $1 authorization returns a
        successful result, we immediately follow up with an automatic void request to ensure that the transaction will disappear
        from the cardholder's statement as soon as possible. 5 Order Process a. Saving unforeseen circumstances, once your
        online order has been processed, it will be delivered within the specified time and dispatched or collected by You

        address being outside its area or territory; v. You are responsible for collection of the goods if collected by pick
        up; vi. delivery time may change depending on conditions at the time (eg traffic, weather, etc), therefore, there is no
        guarantee that an order will be delivered within any specified timeframe; vii. any queries or concerns with an online

        Food Provider with Your payment receipt and order number to request a refund. c. Any refund will be made in the same
        form as the original payment. d. If the Food Provider agrees to a refund, the Food Provider will either refund Your
